- Maintain a single codebase that branches behaviour based on user type while keeping data separation secure.

---

## 2. Personas & Journeys

### 2.1 Individual Learner
1. Lands on marketing site ‚Üí chooses "Practice Now".
2. Authenticates via magic link or passwordless email.
3. Completes quick onboarding (interests, level, goals).
4. Gains access to AI conversation coach and open peer matching (global pool of non-school users).
5. All AI agents available: Conversation Agent (Listener), Solo Practice Agent (Coach), Feedback Agent (Reviewer).
6. Future: Optional premium tiers (architecture supports tiering but not implemented yet).

### 2.2 School Decision Maker / Admin
1. Lands on marketing site ‚Üí chooses "For Schools".
2. Fills request or starts guided flow:
   - School name, country, estimated seats, preferred contact.
   - Chooses plan (seat-based tiers, e.g., Starter 50 seats, Growth 200, Enterprise custom).
   - Payment processing (future: Stripe checkout/invoicing; billing starts immediately upon purchase).
3. System creates `schools` record with selected tier and active status.
4. Sends activation email (existing invitation mechanism) to the admin; upon acceptance their profile becomes `school_admin`.
5. Admin guided setup:
   - Confirm school details and plan.
   - Configure invitation policies (domains, defaults, global matching permissions).
   - Invite teachers/students via bulk email or CSV.
   - Configure student visibility: allow students to partner with public (individual) users or restrict to school-only.

### 2.3 Invited Student/Teacher
1. Receives email invite ‚Üí `/invite/[token]`.
2. Signs in with invited email and accepts.
3. Profile linked to the school; default settings applied; occupies one seat (regular or graduate).
4. Onboarding tuned to school space; matching restricted to same school unless admin enables global matching.
5. All AI agents available: same as individuals (Conversation, Solo Practice, Feedback).
6. Can convert to individual account when leaving school or graduating (via Profile/Settings).

### 2.4 Individual Teacher ‚Üí School Admin Conversion
1. Existing individual user starts "Bring My School" flow.
2. Completes school purchase process (name, seats, payment).
3. Profile migrated to `school_admin` role; `school_id` assigned.
4. Retains conversation history but loses access to global individual matching pool.
5. Can now invite students and manage school settings.

---

## 3. Product Requirements

### 3.1 Account Types & Roles
- `individual` (default): Self-service signup; `school_id = null`; matches globally with other individuals.
- `school_admin`: Manages school; has `school_id`; can invite students/teachers and configure settings.
- `student`: School member; `school_id` enforced; matches within school (or globally if admin permits).
- `teacher`: School member; `school_id` enforced; view analytics, manage curricula (future).
- `graduate`: Former student with extended access; marked via `seat_type = 'graduate'`; can convert to individual.

**Role Transitions:**
- Individual ‚Üí School Admin (via "Bring My School" purchase flow)
- Student/Teacher ‚Üí Individual (via Profile/Settings when leaving school)
- Student ‚Üí Graduate (admin changes seat type; seat remains occupied)

### 3.2 Authentication & Routing
- Shared auth stack (Supabase Auth); magic link/passwordless email for all users.
- Post-login redirect based on role:
  - Individual ‚Üí `/dashboard` (global pool access).
  - School admin ‚Üí `/admin` (guided wizard on first visit).
  - School student/teacher ‚Üí `/dashboard` (school-scoped content).
  - Graduate ‚Üí `/dashboard` (school-scoped unless converted to individual).
- Middleware detects `school_id` for data isolation and RLS enforcement.
- Future: SSO/SAML for enterprise schools (Phase 4+).

### 3.3 Matching Logic & Privacy Boundaries
**Individual Users:**
- Match only with other individuals in global pool.
- Cannot see or match with any school users (students/teachers/graduates).
- Full access to AI solo practice.

**School Students (default):**
- Match only within same `school_id`.
- Never visible in public/global pool.
- If admin enables "allow_global_matching" school setting:
  - Students can match with individuals from global pool.
  - Students remain invisible to individuals until matched.
  - Individuals can see and match with these students only if permitted.
- Seats free immediately when student leaves or is removed.

**Graduates:**
- Match within school until converted to individual.
- Occupy "graduate" seat type (tracked separately in seat allocation).
- Can convert to individual account via Profile/Settings:
  - `school_id` set to `null`; role changes to `individual`.
  - Join global pool; lose access to school-scoped features.
  - Seat freed immediately upon conversion.

**Teachers:**
- No matching; view analytics and manage curricula (future).

**Feature Flags (future):**
- `allow_cross_school_matching`: Inter-school practice sessions.
- `allow_individual_partnership`: Per-school control of global pool access.

### 3.4 Billing & Plans
**Current Implementation:**
- No payment system active; architecture prepared for future monetization.
- All users (individual and school) have full access to all AI agents.

**Future Monetization (architecture supports):**
- **Individuals:** Optional premium tiers (monthly subscription via Stripe).
  - Free tier: Basic access (to be defined in future).
  - Premium tier: Advanced analytics, unlimited sessions, priority matching.

- **Schools:** Seat-based plans billed to school account.
  - Billing starts immediately upon purchase.
  - Plans: Starter (50 seats), Growth (200 seats), Enterprise (custom).
  - Payment via Stripe subscription or manual invoice.

**Seat Management:**
- Track `seats_total`, `seats_regular`, `seats_graduate`, `seats_used`.
- Seat types: `regular` (students/teachers), `graduate` (alumni with extended access).
- Enforce caps when inviting students; prevent exceeding `seats_total`.
- Seats transfer immediately when student leaves or converts to individual.
- Admins notified at 80%, 95%, 100% capacity thresholds.
- Graduate seats count toward total; schools decide allocation split.

### 3.5 Admin Tools
**Implemented:**
- Invitation management (send, track, resend).

**Required (Phase 1-2):**
- Student roster with filters (active, graduate, role).
- Seat allocation dashboard (regular vs. graduate).
- Settings panel:
  - School info (name, country, contact).
  - Invitation policy (allowed domains, default roles).
  - Global matching toggle (allow students to partner with individuals).
  - Student visibility controls.

**Future (Phase 3-4):**
- Activity analytics (sessions, engagement, progress).
- Curriculum builder and topic assignment.
- Billing portal (upgrade/downgrade, seat management).
- Student lifecycle management (mark as graduate, convert to individual).
- Audit logs for admin actions.

### 3.6 Individual Experience
- Onboarding questionnaire to personalise AI conversations (interests, level, goals).
- Immediate access to AI conversation (Solo Practice Agent).
- Open "Practice Lobby" for peer matching with other individuals (global pool only).
- Full access to all AI agents: Conversation Agent (Listener), Solo Practice Agent (Coach), Feedback Agent (Reviewer).
- Privacy: Cannot see or interact with school users unless explicitly matched via school's global partnership setting.
- Future: Nudges to upgrade to premium tier for advanced analytics and features.

### 3.7 AI Agent Availability Matrix

| Agent | Individual | School Student | School Teacher | School Admin | Graduate |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Conversation Agent (Listener)** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full |
| **Solo Practice Agent (Coach)** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full |

- Curriculum system schema not yet implemented
- Analytics would leverage existing session data from Feedback Agent

---

## 5. Data & Security Considerations

### 5.1 Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Enforce RLS by `school_id` for all school-scoped tables (profiles, matches, messages, curricula).
- Individuals (`school_id = null`) isolated from all school data.
- School users can only access data within their `school_id`.
- Middleware validates `school_id` on every request.

### 5.2 Privacy Boundaries
- **Global Pool Isolation:** Individuals cannot query or see school user profiles.
- **School Visibility:** School students never appear in public search/matching unless admin enables global partnership.
- **Matching Permission:** Even with global partnership enabled, individuals only see school students when matched (not in browse/search).
- **Graduate Privacy:** Graduates retain school privacy until converting to individual.

### 5.3 Data Model Additions
**Schools Table:**
```json
plan_details: {
  "plan_tier": "growth",
  "seats_total": 200,
  "seats_regular": 180,
  "seats_graduate": 20,
  "billing_cycle": "annual",
  "price_per_seat": 10,
  "billing_start_date": "2025-01-15"
}
```

**Profiles Table:**
- Add `seat_type` enum: `null` (individual), `regular`, `graduate`.
- Add `allow_global_matching` boolean (per-user override of school setting).

**Schools Table:**
- Add `allow_global_matching` boolean (school-wide setting).
- Add `seats_regular_used`, `seats_graduate_used` (computed or cached).

### 5.4 Seat Counting Logic
- `seats_used = COUNT(profiles WHERE school_id = X AND seat_type IN ('regular', 'graduate'))`.
- Seats freed immediately when:
  - Student removed by admin.
  - Student converts to individual.
  - Profile soft-deleted (future).

### 5.5 Security & Compliance
- Invitation tokens: single-use, expire after 7 days.
- Audit logs for admin actions (invites, seat changes, removals) - Phase 5.
- PII encrypted at rest via Supabase.
- GDPR/FERPA compliance for student data.

### 5.6 Role Transitions
- **Individual ‚Üí School Admin:** Create school record, set `school_id`, change role, retain history.
- **Student/Graduate ‚Üí Individual:** Set `school_id = null`, `seat_type = null`, role = `individual`, free seat immediately.
- **Student ‚Üí Graduate:** Change `seat_type` to `graduate`, adjust seat allocation counters.

---

## 6. Operational Notes

### 6.1 Development & Testing
- Gate `/api/dev/setup-admin` with environment check (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`).
- Provide super-admin tooling for customer success team to:
  - Manually create schools.
  - Invite admins during private beta.
  - Adjust seat allocations (emergency overrides).

### 6.2 KPI Tracking
Track metrics separately for each user type:
- **Individuals:** Active users, sessions completed, conversion to premium (future).
- **Schools:** Total seats purchased, seats utilized (regular vs. graduate), admin engagement.
- **Conversions:** Individual ‚Üí school admin, student ‚Üí individual, student ‚Üí graduate.
- **Matching:** Global pool matches, within-school matches, cross-pool partnerships (if enabled).

### 6.3 Feature Flags
Implement flags for gradual rollout and A/B testing:
- `enable_global_matching_for_schools` - School admin toggle.
- `enable_cross_school_matching` - Inter-school practice (future).
- `enable_graduate_seats` - Graduate seat type (Phase 2).
- `enable_individual_premium` - Premium tier for individuals (Phase 4).
- `enable_ai_voice_sessions` - Voice-based solo practice (experimental).

### 6.4 Support & Communication
- Email templates for:
  - School admin invitation (with setup instructions).
  - Student invitation (school-specific branding).
  - Seat capacity warnings (80%, 95%, 100%).
  - Graduate conversion prompts.
  - Individual ‚Üí school admin migration confirmation.

---

## 7. Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1)

### 7.1 Database Migrations
1. Add `seat_type` enum to profiles table: `null`, `regular`, `graduate`.
2. Add `allow_global_matching` boolean to profiles and schools tables.
3. Add `seats_regular_used`, `seats_graduate_used` to schools table (or use computed view).

   - School admin ‚Üí `/admin` (guided wizard if first visit).
   - School student/teacher ‚Üí `/dashboard` (school-scoped).
2. Middleware to detect and enforce `school_id` boundaries.

### 7.4 Student Lifecycle Management
1. Add "Convert to Individual" button in Profile/Settings:
   - Show only for school students/graduates.
   - Confirmation modal explaining consequences (lose school access).
   - Backend handler: set `school_id = null`, `seat_type = null`, role = `individual`.
2. Update seat counting logic to reflect freed seat immediately.

- Conversation stays on topic
- Encourages student participation with questions
- Maintains conversation history (last 10 messages for context)
- No database storage (ephemeral practice sessions)

**Complexity Guidelines by Level:**
- A1: Simple present/past tense, basic vocabulary, short sentences
- A2: Simple tenses, common phrases, familiar topics
- B1: Past/present/future tenses, complex sentences, everyday topics
- B2: All tenses, complex sentences, abstract topics
- C1: Nuanced language, idiomatic expressions, sophisticated topics
- C2: Native-like fluency, subtle distinctions, any topic

**Agent Behavior:**
- Matches vocabulary and grammar to student level
- Asks open-ended questions to keep conversation flowing
- Provides inline corrections naturally (e.g., "By the way, we say...")
- Maintains friendly, encouraging tone
- Keeps responses 2-3 sentences max
- Focuses on assigned topic

### Technical Decisions

**Why OpenAI Agents SDK?**
- Built-in agent orchestration and state management
- Easy to define agent instructions and behaviors
- Supports streaming responses
- Well-documented and actively maintained
- Allows easy migration to other providers later

**Why gpt-4o-mini?**
- Cost-effective ($0.15 / 1M input tokens)
- Fast response times (important for real-time chat)
- Sufficient intelligence for grammar/topic checking
- Can upgrade to gpt-4o for complex reasoning if needed

**Why Provider Abstraction?**
- Future-proof: Easy to add Anthropic, Cohere, etc.
- A/B testing: Can compare providers for quality/cost
- Reliability: Fallback to different providers if one fails
- Flexibility: Different agents can use different providers

### Performance & Cost Optimization

**Conversation Agent:**
- Cooldown prevents excessive API calls (max 2 per minute)
- Context window limited to recent messages (reduces tokens)
- Returns "OK" quickly when no issues (minimal response)

**Solo Practice Agent:**
- No database storage (reduces infrastructure costs)
- Context limited to last 10 messages
- Responses kept brief (2-3 sentences)

**Feedback Agent:**
- Only run at session end (not real-time)
- Batch processing possible for multiple sessions
- Can cache common patterns

**Estimated Costs (per user per month):**
- Conversation monitoring: ~$0.50 (assuming 100 messages with 50 AI checks)
- Solo practice: ~$1.00 (assuming 20 sessions, 10 messages each)
- Session feedback: ~$0.20 (assuming 5 sessions with summaries)
- **Total: ~$1.70 per active user per month**

### Future AI Enhancements

## 15. AI SDK Integration with Mastra (Phase 1.7)

### Overview

Integrated Vercel AI SDK with Mastra for streaming AI responses in solo practice conversations. This provides real-time progressive message rendering for better user experience.

### Implementation Summary

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Integrated AI SDK v3 with `useChat` hook for streaming
- ‚úÖ Converted message formats using `convertToCoreMessages()`
- ‚úÖ Implemented `toDataStreamResponse()` for streaming API responses
- ‚úÖ Split component to load initial messages before rendering
- ‚úÖ Saved user messages to database with message count increment
- ‚úÖ Saved AI responses in `onFinish` callback
- ‚úÖ Created separate `solo_practice_sessions` and `solo_practice_messages` tables
- ‚úÖ Implemented conditional routing in dashboard (solo vs peer chat)
- ‚úÖ Fixed message persistence and display issues

### Key AI SDK Patterns

#### 1. Message Format Conversion

```typescript
import { convertToCoreMessages } from 'ai';

// UI messages (from useChat) have 'parts' array
const coreMessages = convertToCoreMessages(messages);

// Now compatible with streamText()
const result = streamText({
  model: soloPracticeAgent.model,
  messages: coreMessages,
});
```

#### 2. System Instructions

```typescript
const result = streamText({
  model: soloPracticeAgent.model,
  system: systemInstructions, // ‚úì Correct - separate parameter
  messages: coreMessages,
});

// NOT this:
// messages: [{ role: 'system', content: '...' }, ...messages]  ‚úó Wrong
```

#### 3. Streaming Response

```typescript
return result.toDataStreamResponse();  // ‚úì AI SDK v3 pattern
// NOT: result.toTextStreamResponse()  ‚úó Old pattern
```

#### 4. Initial Messages Pattern

**Problem:** `useChat` must receive initial messages at initialization time, not after mounting.

**Solution:** Split into loader and chat components:

```typescript
// Loader component
export default function SoloPracticeChatInterface({ sessionId }) {
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
  const [initialMessages, setInitialMessages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadMessages() {
      const { data } = await supabase
        .from('solo_practice_messages')
        .select('*')
        .eq('session_id', sessionId);

      setInitialMessages(data.map(msg => ({
        id: msg.id,
        role: msg.role,
        content: msg.content,
      })));
      setIsReady(true);
    }
    loadMessages();
  }, [sessionId]);

  if (!isReady) return <LoadingSpinner />;

  return <ChatInterface initialMessages={initialMessages} />;
}

// Chat interface component
function ChatInterface({ initialMessages }) {
  const { messages, input, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    api: '/api/practice/chat',
    initialMessages,  // Now has messages at initialization
  });
}
```

### Architecture

#### Database Tables

**Solo Practice:**
- `solo_practice_sessions` - Session metadata (topic, proficiency level, goals)
- `solo_practice_messages` - Message history with AI corrections

**Peer Chat:**
- `matches` - Peer-to-peer match records
- `messages` - Conversation history between students

#### Routes

- `/practice` - Topic selection for solo practice
- `/practice/[sessionId]` - Active solo practice chat interface
- `/chat` - Match requests and peer chat list
- `/chat/[matchId]` - Active peer-to-peer chat interface
- `/dashboard` - Unified view of all conversations (both solo and peer)

### API Route Implementation

**File:** `/src/app/api/practice/chat/route.ts`

```typescript
import { streamText, convertToCoreMessages } from 'ai';
import { soloPracticeAgent } from '@/mastra/agents/solo-practice-agent';

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { messages, data } = await req.json();
  const { sessionId, topic, studentLevel, learningGoals, grammarFocus } = data;

  // Convert UI messages to core messages
  const coreMessages = convertToCoreMessages(messages);

  // Stream response using AI SDK
  const result = streamText({
    model: soloPracticeAgent.model,
    system: systemInstructions,
    messages: coreMessages,
    temperature: 0.8,
    async onFinish({ text }) {
      // Save AI response to database
      await supabase.from('solo_practice_messages').insert({
        session_id: sessionId,
        role: 'assistant',
        content: text,
        has_correction: detectCorrection(text),
      });

      // Update session message count
      await supabase.rpc('increment_session_message_count', {
        p_session_id: sessionId,
        p_is_correction: hasCorrection,
      });
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

### Chat Interface Component

**File:** `/src/components/practice/SoloPracticeChatInterface.tsx`

```typescript
// Outer loader component
export default function SoloPracticeChatInterface({ sessionId, session, profile }) {
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
  const [initialMessages, setInitialMessages] = useState([]);

  // Load messages before rendering useChat
  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadMessages() {
      const { data } = await supabase
        .from('solo_practice_messages')
        .select('*')
        .eq('session_id', sessionId)
        .order('created_at', { ascending: true });

      if (data) {
        setInitialMessages(data.map(msg => ({
          id: msg.id,
          role: msg.role,
          content: msg.content,
        })));
      }
      setIsReady(true);
    }
    loadMessages();
  }, [sessionId]);

  if (!isReady) return <LoadingSpinner />;

  return <ChatInterface initialMessages={initialMessages} {...props} />;
}

// Inner chat interface component
function ChatInterface({ initialMessages, sessionId, session, profile }) {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading } = useChat({
    api: '/api/practice/chat',
    body: {
      sessionId,
      topic: session.topic,
      studentLevel: session.proficiency_level || profile.proficiency_level,
      learningGoals: session.learning_goals || [],
      grammarFocus: session.grammar_focus || [],
    },
    initialMessages,
  });

  // Custom submit to save user message to DB
  const customHandleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!input.trim() || isLoading) return;

    // Save user message
    await supabase.from('solo_practice_messages').insert({
      session_id: sessionId,
      role: 'user',
      content: input.trim(),
    });

    // Update message count
    await supabase.rpc('increment_session_message_count', {
      p_session_id: sessionId,
      p_is_correction: false,
    });

    // Let AI SDK handle streaming
    handleSubmit(e);
  };

  return (/* UI with messages and input */);
}
```

### Dashboard Integration

The dashboard fetches both session types and displays them in a unified view:

```typescript
// Fetch peer matches
const { data: matchRows } = await supabase
  .from('matches')
  .select('*')
  .or(`student1_id.eq.${user.id},student2_id.eq.${user.id}`);

// Fetch solo practice sessions
const { data: soloSessions } = await supabase
  .from('solo_practice_sessions')
  .select('*')
  .eq('student_id', user.id);

// Merge and sort by most recent
const matchSummaries = [...peerMatchSummaries, ...soloSessionSummaries]
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.updated_at) - new Date(a.updated_at));
```

**ChatOverview Component** renders with conditional routing:

```typescript
<Link href={
  match.session_type === 'solo'
    ? `/practice/${match.id}`
    : `/chat/${match.id}`
}>
```

Solo practice sessions display with:
- ü§ñ AI Coach avatar
- Purple gradient background
- "Solo Practice" badge
- Topic as matched interest

### Message Flow

```
User types message
  ‚Üì
Save to solo_practice_messages table
  ‚Üì
Increment message count via RPC
  ‚Üì
Send to /api/practice/chat
  ‚Üì
AI SDK streams response
  ‚Üì
Display in real-time (progressive rendering)
  ‚Üì
onFinish: Save AI response to database
  ‚Üì
onFinish: Increment message count (with correction flag)
  ‚Üì
Update UI with complete message
```

### Key Features

- **Real-time streaming**: AI responses appear progressively as they're generated
- **Message persistence**: All messages saved to database for conversation history
- **Grammar corrections**: AI provides inline feedback detected via keywords
- **Topic adherence**: AI keeps conversation on track based on selected topic
- **Level adaptation**: Complexity matches student proficiency (A1-C2 CEFR)
- **Session statistics**: Message count and correction count tracked automatically

### Database RPC Functions

#### increment_session_message_count

Updates session statistics when messages are sent:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_session_message_count(
  p_session_id UUID,
  p_is_correction BOOLEAN
)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE solo_practice_sessions
  SET
    message_count = message_count + 1,
    correction_count = CASE WHEN p_is_correction THEN correction_count + 1 ELSE correction_count END,
    last_activity_at = NOW(),
    updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = p_session_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

Called from:
1. **Client**: After saving user message
2. **API**: In `onFinish` callback after AI response

### Files Modified/Created

**New Files:**
- `/src/app/api/practice/chat/route.ts` - Streaming API endpoint
- `/src/components/practice/SoloPracticeChatInterface.tsx` - Chat UI with loader pattern
- `/src/mastra/agents/solo-practice-agent.ts` - Mastra agent definition

**Modified Files:**
- `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fetch and merge solo + peer sessions
- `/src/components/dashboard/ChatOverview.tsx` - Conditional routing logic
- Database migrations - Added solo practice tables and RPC functions

### Key Takeaways

1. **AI SDK v3 Patterns**: Use `convertToCoreMessages()`, `toDataStreamResponse()`, and system parameter
2. **Message Persistence**: Both user and AI messages must be saved to database separately
3. **Initial Messages**: Load before rendering `useChat` hook to avoid empty state
4. **Unified Dashboard**: Merge different session types for seamless UX
5. **Conditional Routing**: Use `session_type` to determine correct route
6. **RPC Functions**: Update session statistics consistently
