# Authentication Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document explains the performance optimizations made to the authentication system to reduce database queries on every request.

## Problem

Previously, the middleware was making 1-2 database queries on **every protected route** to fetch the user's role from the `profiles` table. This caused:
- Increased latency on every page load
- Unnecessary database load
- Poor performance under high traffic

## Solution: JWT Custom Claims

We now store the user's `role` directly in the JWT token's custom claims. This allows the middleware to read the role without any database queries.

### How It Works

1. **Database Function**: A PostgreSQL function (`custom_access_token_hook`) is triggered when a JWT is issued
2. **Role Injection**: The function reads the user's role from the `profiles` table and adds it to the JWT
3. **Middleware Reads Claims**: Middleware extracts `user_role` from JWT claims instead of querying the database
4. **Fallback Support**: If role is not in claims (old tokens), middleware falls back to database query

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply the Migration

The SQL migration is located at:
```
supabase/migrations/add_role_to_jwt_claims.sql
```

Apply it using Supabase CLI or run it directly in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 2: Enable the Hook in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Hooks**
3. Find **Custom Access Token** hook
4. Enable it and select: `public.custom_access_token_hook`
5. Save changes

### Step 3: Test the Implementation

1. Sign out from your application
2. Sign back in
3. Check browser DevTools > Application > Cookies
4. Decode the JWT token at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)
5. Verify `user_role` appears in the claims

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization
- **Auth Route Check**: 1 DB query per request
- **Admin Route Check**: 1 DB query per request
- **Total**: 1-2 DB queries on every protected route

### After Optimization
- **Auth Route Check**: 0 DB queries (reads from JWT)
- **Admin Route Check**: 0 DB queries (reads from JWT)
- **Total**: 0 DB queries on every protected route
- **Fallback**: 1 DB query only if JWT doesn't have role (backward compatibility)

### Expected Improvements
- ðŸš€ **50-200ms faster** page loads on protected routes
- ðŸ“‰ **90% reduction** in database queries for auth checks
- ðŸ’ª Better scalability under high traffic

## Code Changes

### Middleware (`src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`)

```typescript
// Extract role from JWT custom claims
const userRole = claims?.user_role as string | undefined;

// Use cached role instead of querying DB
if (userRole === 'school_admin') {
  // Fast path: no DB query needed
  url.pathname = '/admin';
} else {
  // Fallback: query DB only if role not in claims
  // (backward compatibility for old sessions)
}
```

## Security Considerations

âœ… **Secure**: JWT tokens are signed by Supabase and cannot be tampered with
âœ… **Up-to-date**: Tokens are refreshed automatically by Supabase SSR
âœ… **Revocable**: Sign out invalidates the token immediately
âœ… **Read-only**: Custom claims are set server-side, not by client

## Troubleshooting

### Role not appearing in JWT

**Cause**: User signed in before hook was enabled

**Solution**: Sign out and sign back in to get a new token with the role

### Still seeing database queries

**Cause**: Fallback is being used (role not in claims)

**Solution**:
1. Verify hook is enabled in Supabase Dashboard
2. Check function exists: `SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'custom_access_token_hook';`
3. Users need to sign out/in to get new tokens

### Role changes not reflecting immediately

**Cause**: Role is cached in JWT until token refresh

**Solution**:
- JWT tokens auto-refresh every ~60 minutes
- For immediate effect, user must sign out and sign back in
- For admin role changes, consider forcing a sign-out

## Future Enhancements

- Add `school_id` to JWT claims for even faster school-scoped queries
- Cache `onboarding_completed` flag in JWT
- Consider adding `subscription_tier` for billing checks
