# AGENT.md â€” EduMatch AI Agent Specification

## Overview

**EduMatch** is an AI-assisted speaking-practice platform for schools and students.
The platform connects students based on shared interests and proficiency levels, enabling **AI-moderated real-time conversations** in text or voice.
AI agents listen, correct grammar, redirect topic drift, and provide post-session feedback aligned with school curricula.

Agents are built using the **Mastra Framework** (primary) with OpenAI as a fallback provider, integrated into the Next.js + Supabase architecture via the **AI SDK** (`@ai-sdk/react`, `@ai-sdk/openai`).

---

## 4. Data Flow & Context Management

### 4.1 Core Data Flow

1. **Student Login**
   Authenticated through Supabase Auth.
   Student profile and school association retrieved via Supabase MCP.

2. **Match Creation**
   Matching logic based on interest, level, and topic (via Supabase MCP query).
   Session record created; Conversation Agent attached.

3. **Live Conversation**
   Messages streamed to OpenAI Realtime API through AI SDK.
   Conversation Agent observes stream, applies correction and redirection rules.
   AI interventions posted as `system` messages back to Supabase.

4. **Session End**
   Feedback Agent triggered via event (`match.status = ended`).
   Summaries stored in `feedback_logs` and `session_reports`.

5. **Teacher Dashboard**
   Admin Agent aggregates reports via Supabase MCP.
   Shadcn MCP renders tables, badges, and progress charts.

### 4.2 Context Compression Strategy

**Problem:** Long conversations exceed AI context windows (100+ messages).

**Solution:** Sliding Window + Rolling Summaries

**Messages Tables - Per-Message Analytics:**

**Peer Chat (matches + messages):**
```
messages:
  - content (text) - actual message
  - message_type (enum) - text/voice/system/correction/redirect
  - grammar_issues (jsonb) - detailed grammar analysis
  - ai_correction (text) - AI's suggested correction
  - topic_relevance_score (numeric) - topic adherence
  - audio_url, transcript, audio_duration - for voice
  - read_by (uuid[]) - message read tracking
```

**Solo Practice (text_practice_sessions + text_practice_messages):**
```
text_practice_messages:
  - session_id (uuid) - FK to text_practice_sessions
  - role (text) - 'user' or 'assistant'
  - content (text) - message text
  - message_type (text) - 'text', 'correction', 'encouragement'
  - grammar_issues (jsonb) - detailed error analysis
  - ai_correction (text) - correction text
  - correction_severity (text) - 'minor', 'moderate', 'major'
  - is_correct (boolean) - âœ… NEW: true if no grammar errors
  - has_correction (boolean) - whether correction was shown
  - corrected_message_id (uuid) - links correction to original message
  - created_at (timestamp)
```

**Conversation Summaries Table - Compressed Context:**
```
conversation_summaries:
  - id (uuid)
  - match_id (uuid) - FK to matches
  - summary_window_start (timestamp) - first message in window
  - summary_window_end (timestamp) - last message in window
  - message_count (int) - how many messages compressed
  - compressed_context (text) - AI-generated summary of window
  - key_grammar_patterns (text[]) - recurring patterns found
  - topic_keywords (text[]) - main topics discussed
  - notable_corrections (jsonb[]) - only important corrections
  - participant_turns (jsonb) - {student_id: turn_count}
  - created_at (timestamp)
```

**Context Window Strategy:**

**For Conversation Agent (Real-time):**
1. **Recent Window:** Last 10-15 raw messages (full detail)
2. **Historical Summaries:** Previous compressed summaries (condensed)
3. **Session Stats:** Running totals (grammar issues, topic drift)
4. **Curriculum Context:** Active topic + grammar focus

**For Feedback Agent (Post-session):**
1. **Full Access:** All messages with complete analytics
2. **Summary Snapshots:** Pre-computed summaries for overview
3. **Aggregated Patterns:** session_reports table for high-level insights

**For Teacher/Student Reports:**
- Teachers get full message history + detailed analytics
- Students get friendly summaries + highlighted corrections
- Both get visual charts from aggregated data

**Compression Triggers:**
- Auto-create summary every 20 messages
- Manual trigger when context approaches token limit
- End-of-session final summary

## 5. Agent Context Model

Each agent receives a unified **context envelope**:

| Context Key | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `user_profiles` | Basic info, proficiency level, interests |
| `curriculum_topic` | Current school topic and grammar focus |
| `conversation_history` | Recent transcript window (last N turns) |
| `school_policy` | School or teacher-defined preferences |
| `agent_config` | Temperature, intervention frequency, tone settings |
| `permissions` | Access rules based on role (student/teacher/admin) |

Agents query and update context data using the **Supabase MCP**.  
Sensitive data (emails, API keys) never leave MCP boundaries.

---

## 6. Behavioral Policies

1. **Minimal Disruption** â€” AI interjects sparingly; prioritizes natural flow.  
2. **Tone & Safety** â€” Friendly, inclusive, positive; compliant with school safety filters.  
3. **Pedagogical Alignment** â€” Corrections match grammar focus defined in curriculum.  
4. **Privacy** â€” Agents do not store or reuse raw student conversation text beyond session scope.  
5. **Adaptability** â€” Language complexity dynamically adjusts per user level.
6. **Safety** - No Negative thoughts or conversations, No Conversation about SEX, SUICIDE, anything that can affect Student in bad way.
